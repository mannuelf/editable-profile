# Spark Editable Profile

Editable Profile project for Spark Networks.

This is a mono repository containing two applications. Each application has it own Dockerfile which the docker compose yaml file uses to build the images, you will use `make` commands to do so.

1. client
2. api

## Make

To start run helpful make command:

```bash
make help
```

### Local development

To start run:

```bash
make up
```

This will bring up three services.

1. API, running on http://localhost:3001
2. Client, running on http://localhost:3000
3. MongoDB, running on mongodb://localhost:27017. A database called `sparkapps` will be created upon first POST to api.

Alternatively you may also try,

```bash
cd /api && npm run dev
cd /client && npm start
```

## Client

I have chosen React Js for the front end. I've used `create-react-app` to scaffold the app. I am using SASS (Sass flavour). I am also using Bulma front end framework.

## Api

I am using an express server for the back-end. I used `express-generator` to scaffold the app. using MonogoDB for the database. I am using Docker and docker-compose to manage containers.

I've setup seven routes for the given endpoints, and setup on POST route to save the image. I have also setup a user route to update a user.

You may hit these routes with your favourite API tool, I'm enjoying insomnia at the moment.

| Request  | URI  | Description |
|---|---|---|
| POST | http://localhost:3001/user/   | Add user   |
| GET  | http://localhost:3001/user/  | Get all users  |
| PUT  | http://localhost:3001/user/:id  | Update existing user  |
| DEL  | http://localhost:3001/user/:id  | Delete user   |
| GET  | http://localhost:3001/user/attributes  | Get user attributes |
| GET  | http://localhost:3001/locations/cities  | Get locations, cities |
| POST | http://localhost:3001/upload  | Upload image |
