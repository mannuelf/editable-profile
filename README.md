# Editable Profile

Editable Profile project for Spark networks.

I have chosen React Js for the front end and express server for the back-end, using MonogoDB for the database. I am using Docker and docker-compose to manage containers.

## Local development

- I have dockerised the client which is a react app.
- I have dockerised the api which is an express app.

To start run helpful make commands:

```bash
make help

make build

make client-up

make api-up
```
